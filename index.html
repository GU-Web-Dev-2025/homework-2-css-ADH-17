        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p> Ayden Humphries was born in Dallas, Texas and was raised there until he was 10 years old. From there he moved to a small
            town called Sequim in Washington state. Here he would go on to become president of his High Schools service club, leading
            a movement to house homeless youth in his area. It was here he created a Tik-Tok that caught the attention
            of George Clooney. He spoke in front of Seattle 4 Rotary, the 4th International Rotary Club to be established, and he managed
            to raise several thousands of dollars for the Joe Rantz Rotary Youth House. 
            Ayden has 8 siblings and as the oldest is no stranger to rangling chaos. He is currently developing an application to help users
            fight porn addictions and hopes to be able to offer that service free to anyone who is struggling. As he believes
            no one should have to pay for tools to help improve their lives.
